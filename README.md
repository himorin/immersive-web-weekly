# Immersive Web Weekly

This repo contains the content for both the Immersive Web Weekly email newsletter and [ImmersiveWebWeekly.com](https://immersivewebweekly.com).

All work in the Immersive Web Weekly repository, site, and email newsletter will follow the [Immersive Web Code of Conduct](https://immersive-web.github.io/homepage/code-of-conduct.html).

The goal of the Immersive Web Weekly is to regularly share a short set of news links related to the immersive web, WebXR, and the open web in general. The links will come from the Immersive Web Community and Working Groups members.

## How to submit links

If you have a link to a news article, event, artwork, or project that is directly related to the immersive web then we welcome your help!

Each issue's links are collected in a GitHub Pull Request. To submit a link, head over to the [IWW Pull Requests](https://github.com/immersive-web/immersive-web-weekly/pulls) and look for a PR titled something like "IWW Issue 011: July 21 2020" for the current issue and date. Add a comment to that PR using this template:

	Link: https://example.com/
	Authors: Alice Smith and Bob Fe
	Summary: A short description of what is at the link and why it's related to the immersive web

We keep each issue pretty short so we won't necessarily use every link submitted but we keep track of them all and they may appear in a later issue.
