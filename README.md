# Immersive Web Weekly

Status: We are the process of setting this up so there's not much here at the moment. Take a look in the [IWW administrivia project](https://github.com/immersive-web/administrivia/projects/2) for details. 

This repo will contain the content for both the Immersive Web Weekly email newsletter and [ImmersiveWebWeekly.com](https://immersivewebweekly.com).

The goal of the Immersive Web Weekly is to regularly share a short set of news links related to the immersive web, WebXR, and the open web in general. The links will come from the Immersive Web Community and Working Groups members.

Watch this space for how to submit links.

[Jordan Santell](https://jsantell.com/) (@jsantell) created the Immersive Web Weekly and graciously offered to transfer it over to the Immersive Web CG. [Trevor F. Smith](https://trevor.smith.name/) has stepped up to be the editor so reach out to @TrevorFSmith (or trevor@transmutable.com) or use the [tagged Issues](https://github.com/immersive-web/administrivia/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aimmersive-web-weekly) to discuss.
